Notes on updating the mpdf library. The library is installed by composer
but results are checked into the plugin repository. Similar to what we do
in DokuWiki core. Because mpdf has some dependencies that are already
satisfied in DokuWiki core, they do not need to be installed by the plugin
again. To do so we declare them as replaced in the composer.json. The
.gitignore is used to skip checking in unneeded library files like examples
etc.

Updating should be done via composer update --no-dev --prefer-dist
